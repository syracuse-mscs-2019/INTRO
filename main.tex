\begin{itemize}
  \item Executive Summary:
  This is the executive summary and academic statement that I vouch for my work. It is my own and completed to the best of my ability given time constraints. I was not able to proofcheck everything to my satisfaction, and in particular am still unsure of the "Acknowledgements" section however adhering to the professor's advice I am submitting as-is rather than falling behind. I hope that my work schedule here will reduce soon and we get weekends back, or I may have to drop the course. Until that is decided I am trying my best to keep up, and will give it my all.

  \item Why I Picked My Program of Study:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item I wanted a degree both versatile and fitting my interests and talents.
  \end{itemize}
  \item Why I Am Taking Assurance Fundamentals
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item I am extremely interested in assurance and it's DoD applications.
    \item It is one of the only courses that fits my +8hr time zone..
  \end{enumerate}
  \item What I Hope to Learn in Assurance Fundamentals:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item I would greatly like to be able to proof my code mathematically, something I've long admired but so far been unable to find adequate documentation and time to teach myself. Looking forward to learning!
